	abstract = {In this paper, we present a system that acts as an automatic facilitator by supporting the flow of communication in a group conversation activity. The system monitors the group members' non-verbal behavior and promotes balanced participation, giving targeted directives to the participants through peripheral displays. We describe an initial study to compare two ways of influencing participantsfi social dynamics: overt directives, explicit recommendations of social actions displayed in the form of text; or subtle directives, where the same recommendations are provided in an implicit manner. Our study indicates that, when the participants understand how the implicit messages work, the subtle facilitation is regarded as more useful than the overt one and it is considered to more positively influence the group behavior.},

Web-based tools for civic engagement, while promising, are still disconnected from meaningful physical locations where citizens usually meet and might limit the involvement of a considerable portion of the citizen population. We propose a system, Agora2.0, designed to recover the useful function that public places have had in the past in promoting and regulating citizens' participation in public decisions. Agora2.0 is inspired by the old concept of the Greek agora, or public square. It is composed of an onsite interactive public display and an online site. We present the project, the analysis of the requirements, the system prototype, and its evaluation during deployments in a university and in a public relations office of a European city.},

Initial results are encouraging, since they suggest that the limitation of expressiveness imposed by the pre-defined sentences do not hinder the possibility of creating sensible and creative stories.},

	abstract = {Since they can integrate a wide range of interactive modalities, multimodal interfaces are considered to improve accessibility for a variety of users, including older adults. However, only few works have actually explored how older adults approach multimodal interaction outside specific contexts and have done so mainly in comparison to much younger users. This study explores how older (65+ years old), middle-aged (55-65 years old) and younger adults (25-35 years old) use mobile multimodal interaction in an everyday activity (i.e. taking photos with a tablet) by using midair gestures and voice commands, and investigates the differences and similarities between the considered age groups. Preliminary findings from a video-analysis show that all groups easily combine the proposed modalities when interacting with a tablet device. Furthermore, compared to younger adults, older and middle-aged adults show similarities in the way they perform gesture and voice commands.},

	abstract = {Social media are implemented by organisations to enhance productivity and knowledge sharing among employees, but they can also support group deliberation and employee voice. This paper presents a case study of an online deliberation initiative involving the discussion of a contentious internal policy within an organisation of around 550 knowledge workers. The deliberation process lasted 5 weeks and actively involved 167 employees. Different sources of information (user interaction logs, activity patterns, questionnaire responses) were analysed to investigate the impact of participation, or non-participation, on the level of satisfaction with the deliberation, and on the understanding of the issue discussed. The findings suggest that (1) interest is a driver for participation, but it does not explain active participation, (2) participation, either active or passive, positively influences the understanding of the issue and (3) satisfaction with the outcome is not related to participation, but it may support participation in future initiatives.},

In the class game, stretches of distance travelled in a sustainable way by each child contributes to the advancement of the whole school on a collective virtual trip. During the trip, several virtual stops are associated with the discovery of playful learning material. The approach has been evaluated in a primary school with 87 pupils and 6 teachers actively involved in the learning activity for 12 continuous weeks. The findings from the questionnaires with parents and the interviews with teachers show a positive effect in terms of children's behavioural change as well as educational value. Indications on the use of class and school collaborative gamification activities for supporting sustainable behavioural change are discussed.},

We conducted semi-structured interviews, focus groups and co-design workshops with 41 employees and HR managers of six knowledge organizations. We investigated their views on participative forms of welfare, the factors that can sustain or hinder collaboration among co-workers and the role technology can play in sustaining these practices. The findings shed light on perceived values and potential barriers of social and organizational arrangements as well as the mediating role of interpersonal trust, social exchange and reciprocity. Furthermore, the results provide insights on how digital platforms can support orchestration and management of collaborative practices grounded on employee participation and on the interplay between work and family life spheres.},
