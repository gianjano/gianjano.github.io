ECOMODE was a research project funded under Horizon 2020, in which we developed an innovative technology that allows visually impaired people and older adults to interact with mobile technology using mid-air gestures and voice controls. 
ECOMODE technology integrates a neuromorphic camera inspired by human vision, making it possible to control smartphones and tablet devices with multimodal interaction, regardless of environmental conditions and background noise.
