Partners: University of Trento 🇮🇹, Amnesty Bulgaria 🇧🇬, Amnesty Slovenia 🇸🇮 and Amnesty Poland 🇵🇱<br>

<br>The project aims to prevent and combat gender-based violence (including cyber violence) among
young people within formal and non-formal learning settings, by addressing masculinities and
increasing the engagement of men and boys in supporting the development of non-violent
relationships. <br>

StandByMe provides a suite of tools for the development of interactive educational paths co-
created with young people, their educators and teachers, to tackle prejudices, negative stereotypes and sexism. <br>

The final goal is to promote a culture of mutual tolerance, critical thinking and social inclusion through
inter-cultural and inter-community learning, in order to raise awareness on the phenomenon, mitigate
potential damages caused by gender-based violence, and reduce the problems associated with
reporting of (early signs of) violence, its dark numbers and victimization.<br>
