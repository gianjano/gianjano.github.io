Hi! I am a User Experience (Ux) researcher with a background in psychology, currently researcher at <a href="https://www.fbk.eu/en/">Fondazione Bruno Kessler â€“ FBK</a>. I received my PhD in Cognitive Science from CIMeC â€“ Center for Mind/Brain Science â€“ University of Trento (Italy) and my MSc in Experimental Psychology from the University of Padova (Italy).

My research centers on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), focusing on the design, development, and evaluation of collaborative, social, and accessible technologies. 

My current research is at the boundary of HCI and artificial intelligence to explore issues surrounding AI literacy and human-AI interaction.
